# CryptoClustering

## Overview

The Crypto Clustering initiative strives to employ unsupervised learning methods, particularly K-means clustering, to anticipate whether cryptocurrencies exhibit responsiveness to either 24-hour or 7-day price fluctuations. Moreover, the project delves into investigating the influence of dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the clustering process.

## Steps

* Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

## Conclusion

This project assesses how employing a reduced number of features affects data clustering through K-means. By comparing the clustering outcomes of the initial dataset and the PCA-processed data, it allows for a comprehensive comprehension of the impact of dimensionality reduction on the clustering procedure.
